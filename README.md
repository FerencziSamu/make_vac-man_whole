Log in with your g-mail account. The first user is going to be admin.
If you use the application for the first time, you will see that your account is not approved. 
Your registration needs to be approved by an administrator.
Once you have been given the necessary accesses, you will see a calendar on 
your home page. If you have the right level of accesses, you will be able to create new requests via
clicking on the calendar. Once it is submitted, it needs to be approved by an administrator.
You can also choose if you would like to get email notifications regarding any changes to your request at the
account tab. You can see your remaining holidays too here. You can report bugs/errors via clicking the 
'help' tab and select 'report bug'. You can find information about the app on the same 'help' tab by 
clicking on the 'About' item. You can log out from the application via clicking on the 'Log out' tab.
Thank you for using the Vacation Manager app!
